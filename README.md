This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model using the Random Forest Regressor to predict weekly sales based on various factors such as holiday flags, temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate. The goal is to apply a regression technique to forecast sales in a retail setting.
Project Overview

The dataset used in this project contains various features like Weekly_Sales, Holiday_Flag, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment, with the objective of predicting the weekly sales of a store. The model employs Random Forest Regressor, a robust machine learning algorithm, to make these predictions.
Dataset

The dataset consists of the following columns:

  - Store: Store identifier
  - Date: The date of the weekly sales record
  - Weekly_Sales: The total sales for the week
  - Holiday_Flag: A binary flag indicating if there was a holiday in the week (1 if holiday, 0 otherwise)
  - Temperature: Temperature in the store's region
  - Fuel_Price: Fuel price in the store's region
  - CPI: Consumer Price Index for the store's region
  - Unemployment: Unemployment rate for the store's region

Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict the Weekly_Sales based on the input features. The model will be trained using historical sales data and various external factors such as economic indicators, temperature, and holiday flags.
Steps Involved

    Data Preprocessing:
        Load the dataset and explore its structure.
        Handle any missing values or outliers.
        Convert the Date column to a datetime object.
        Create new features like Year, Month, and Week for better time series analysis.
        Drop irrelevant or redundant columns, such as the original Date column.

    Feature Engineering:
        Add features that could be useful for prediction, such as Holiday_Flag, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment.

    Model Selection:
        Use Random Forest Regressor to predict Weekly_Sales.
        Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
        Train the model and evaluate its performance using the R² score.

    Sales Forecasting:
        Use the trained model to predict weekly sales for future periods.
        Visualize the predictions against the actual sales to evaluate the model's performance.

    Model Evaluation:
        Evaluate the model's performance using the R² score, a measure of how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
